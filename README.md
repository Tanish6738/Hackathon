üîç Problem Statement

In large public gatherings such as fairs, festivals, or disaster-affected areas, it becomes extremely difficult and time-consuming to manually identify and reunite lost individuals‚Äîespecially children and elderly people‚Äîwith their families. Traditional methods rely heavily on verbal communication, public announcements, or paper records, which are inefficient, prone to human error, and often result in delays or missed reunions.

There is a critical need for an automated, intelligent system that can:
	‚Ä¢	Accurately detect and recognize faces,
	‚Ä¢	Match them against a dynamic database of missing/found individuals, and
	‚Ä¢	Instantly notify relevant parties through a secure and fast communication channel.

This project addresses the problem by developing a Lost & Found system powered by facial recognition, enabling quick identification and real-time alerts to assist authorities and families in reuniting individuals effectively.

Great ‚Äî let‚Äôs differentiate your Lost & Found Facial Recognition System from Dhruv AI, which is currently deployed by the Indian Railways for a similar purpose.

‚öñ Comparison with Existing Solutions (like Dhruv AI)

Feature / Factor	Dhruv AI	Your Proposed System
Deployment Area	Primarily at railway stations	Scalable to fairs, festivals, disaster zones, schools, etc.
Database Handling	Static centralized database	Dynamic, live-updated database (edge + cloud)
Target Users	Mostly focused on tracking criminals/missing children	Focused on all missing individuals, including elderly
Facial Recognition	High-end but limited to CCTVs in railway premises	Can be integrated with mobile cams, drones, kiosks
Alert System	Internal notification to railway authorities	Real-time multichannel alerts (SMS, WhatsApp, email) to families/officials
Community Reporting	No	Allows public to report found individuals via app/web
Language & Accessibility	Limited	Multilingual & accessible UI for mass adoption
Integration Potential	Specific to railway infrastructure	Open API for NGOs, Police, Rescue teams, event organizers


‚∏ª

üß† Key Differentiator:

While Dhruv AI is a station-specific surveillance tool, your system aims to be a universal, real-time, multi-platform solution focused on reuniting all missing individuals ‚Äî not just at stations, but anywhere.
