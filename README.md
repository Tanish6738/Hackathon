# Dhruv - AI : A Guiding Star for Uniting Lost Souls

## üîç Problem Statement

In large public gatherings such as fairs, festivals, or disaster-affected areas, it becomes extremely difficult and time-consuming to manually identify and reunite lost individuals‚Äîespecially children and elderly people‚Äîwith their families. Traditional methods rely heavily on verbal communication, public announcements, or paper records, which are inefficient, prone to human error, and often result in delays or missed reunions.

There is a critical need for an automated, intelligent system that can:
- Accurately detect and recognize faces
- Match them against a dynamic database of missing/found individuals
- Instantly notify relevant parties through a secure and fast communication channel

This project addresses the problem by developing a Lost & Found system powered by facial recognition, enabling quick identification and real-time alerts to assist authorities and families in reuniting individuals effectively.

## üöÄ Key Features

- Real-time facial recognition using advanced AI models
- Dynamic, live-updated database (edge + cloud)
- Multi-platform integration: CCTV, mobile cameras, drones, kiosks
- Instant multichannel alerts (SMS, WhatsApp, email)
- Community reporting via app/web
- Multilingual & accessible UI
- Open API for NGOs, police, rescue teams, event organizers
- Scalable architecture for various environments (fairs, festivals, schools, etc.)
- Image Enhancement and preprocessing for better recognition accuracy
- Secure data handling and privacy measures and Authentication using Clerk
- User-friendly interface for families and authorities
- Admin dashboard for monitoring and managing the system
- Tool for generating the image of lost individuals after a time gap (like how they would look after a few years)
- Integration with existing systems (e.g., police databases, NGO networks)

## ‚öñÔ∏è Comparison with Existing Solutions (e.g., Dhruv AI)

| Feature / Factor         | Dhruv AI (Indian Railways)                  | Lost & Found Facial Recognition System (This Project)         |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Deployment Area**     | Primarily at railway stations               | Scalable to fairs, festivals, disaster zones, schools, etc.  |
| **Database Handling**   | Static centralized database                 | Dynamic, live-updated database (edge + cloud)                |
| **Target Users**        | Tracking criminals/missing children         | All missing individuals, including elderly                   |
| **Facial Recognition**  | CCTV in railway premises                    | Mobile cams, drones, kiosks, and more                        |
| **Alert System**        | Internal notification to authorities        | Real-time multichannel alerts to families/officials          |
| **Community Reporting** | No                                          | Yes, via app/web                                             |
| **Language & Accessibility** | Limited                              | Multilingual & accessible UI                                 |
| **Integration Potential** | Specific to railway infrastructure        | Open API for NGOs, police, rescue teams, event organizers    |

**Key Differentiator:**

While Dhruv AI is a station-specific surveillance tool, this system is a universal, real-time, multi-platform solution focused on reuniting all missing individuals‚Äîanywhere, not just at stations.
